        <p>
        <p align="left">Genevieve Guenther wrote <em>The Language of Climate Politics: Fossil-Fuel Propaganda and How to Fight It</em> just before Donald Trump was elected president for a second time. Her book does not analyze the current administration but it provides information, perspectives, ideas, tools, and insights that can and should be brought to bear on what is currently happening with our national government and climate change.</p>
        <p align="left">This assignment is your opportunity to make your own   analysis of statements, policies, or activities of the Trump Administration drawing at least in part on what you have learned from Guenther's book. A blog is a perfect place to share your analysis more broadly.</p>
        <p align="left">I have created the blog <a href="http://4120climatepolitics.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Climate Politics</a> for this assignment and I will send you by email an invitation to contribute.</p>
        <p align="center">About Your Blog Post</p>
        <p align="left">A blog is a "web log" -- in its most essential form, a commentary on other sites on the web. Write on the blog in a public voice, thoughtfully and carefully, appropriate not only to the academic project of the class, but mindful that your writing is published to a world-wide audience.&nbsp;</p>
		 <p align="left">The blog is an easy-to-use space that allows you to incorporate text, images, and links, and to receive commentary by your classmates and other readers. I suggest drafting blog entries first in your own word processing program before cutting and pasting into the blog. (It has happened that text written in the blog window has disappared before it is published. Using your own program protects you from losing text.)</p>
        <p align="left">Each blog post should meet these minimum requirements:&nbsp;</p>
		  <blockquote>
        <p align="left">1. Evidence of on-line research and carefully thinking.</p>
        <p align="left">2. Include at least 3 links. (Don't just write the word "here" and make it a link or, at the other extreme, don't write out the full URL of the source. Instead, as you refer to it in your text, make either the key idea or the title a link to the full URL. When the links are there you don't need to have a separate bibliography.)&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">3. Your post should be between 400-600 words.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">4. Your post should be visually attractive. Each post needs to include at least two or more relevant images. Create a link between images and their source.</p>
			  </blockquote>
        <p align="left">You are also expected to read and comment on at least 10 blog posts of your classmates. Replies should not just say "good job" but join in the conversation about the post, comment on specific points in the post, open dialogue, raise questions and ideas, and further the thinking. &nbsp;</p>
