          English Language Arts in<br>Secondary Schools</strong></font> </p>
        
        <p align="center"><p align="left">In an effort to prepare future secondary English teachers for the students and classrooms of the 21st Century, this section of English 4810 will focus on a justice, inquiry, and action approach. In so doing we will address the Common Core Standards, changing student populations, and reform movements in the the teaching of literature including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader-response_criticism" target="_blank">reader response</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy" target="_blank">digital literacy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_pedagogy" target="_blank">critical pedagogy</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies" target="_blank">cultural studies</a>. </p>
        <p align="left">(In this course the term "critical inquiry" is in the tradition of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory" target="_blank">critical theory</a>," not the more abstracted, decontextualized, and superficial approach of "<a href="https://www.rasmussen.edu/student-experience/college-life/critical-thinking-skills-to-master-now/" target="_blank">critical thinking skills</a>." Likewise, the term "<a href="https://www.sac.edu/AcademicAffairs/TracDat/Pages/Inquiry-Based-Learning-.aspx" target="_blank">inquiry</a>" is richer than the simpler, but also of value, expression "<a href="http://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/energy-and-the-polar-environment/questioning-techniques-research-based-strategies-for-teachers" target="_blank">questioning strategies</a>.")</p>
        <p align="left">
        <p align="left">After the first part of the semester directed by the instructor, students will take significant responsiblity for course, choosing the reading, creating assignments and activities, and assessing learning 
          as we explore critical inquiry approaches to developing meaningful curriculum and instruction in contemporary secondary schools. 
          This approach represents an experiment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Freire" target="_blank">Frierian</a> teacher-student, student-teacher education. </p>
        <p align="left">
        <p align="left">In an era of anti-democratic governmentality, attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion, <a href="https://educatorvoices.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/what-have-schools-got-to-do-with-neo-liberalism/" target="_blank">neo-liberal educational reform</a>, standardized testing, the corporatization of curriculum, and attacks on "critical race theory" and teacher freedom, future teachers need to think critically about established curriculum regimes and consider how to develop the freedom they need to prepare their students as global citizens in an unfinished, indeed endangered, democracy threatened by demogoguery, inequality, and global heating. </p>
        <p align="left">
        <p align="center">Justice, Inquiry, and Action</p>
        <p align="left">The starting point  for a critical inquiry, social justice approach to teaching English language arts is engaging with critical issues in the world and in the lives of adolescents via relevant and meaningful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_learning" target="_blank">thematic curriculum</a>. In dialogue with student questions and interest, English language arts teachers should be able to  bring together a wide  range of cultural materials, including traditional works, multicultural and young adult literature, visual and media texts including film, and cultural and informational texts, and address <em>what</em> texts mean, as well as <em>how</em> they mean, in historical, cultural, political, and social contexts. </p>
        <p align="left">English Language Arts teachers also need to inspire writing in ways that foster inquiry, student voices, self- and cultural-understanding, and make a difference.</p>
<p align="left">In English 4800 teachers are considered to be <em>transformative intellectuals</em>, producers rather than transmitters of knowledge. More than simply being a <em>reflective</em> pracitioner who can rethink teaching practices in order to improve them, this course also aims to prepare you to be a <em>critical</em> practitioner, a teacher who leads inquiry into social, cultural, and ideological issues, and finds ways to support students acting upon what they learn.</p>
<p align="left">
<p align="left">Thematic teaching facilitates teaching that addresses different abilities, learning styles, and backgrounds. English as a second language students now consitute <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/the-english-learner-student-population-in-charts/2024/06" target="_blank">10.6% of the school population</a> in the United States, and their numbers continue to  increase. This class will focus on developing curriculum that will foster the engagement and success of all students. </p>
        
        <p align="left">By examining relevant, challenging, and potentially controversial topics for justice, inquiry, and action teaching during the student-led portion of the course, future teachers will gain understanding of  approaches, strategies, curriculum, and issues involved in teaching English at the secondary level, see <a href="engl480goals.html" target="_blank">Course Goals</a>. 
        (You may also want to review the WMU teacher education <a>Mission</a>.) </p>
        <p align="left">
        <p align="left">Student groups will select topics addressing current and 
          controversial areas to inquire into such as: </p>

		  <p align="center">Artificial Intelligence, New Technologies, Writing, and Inquiry</p>               
        <p align="left">Rapid evolution in AI technology offers many avenues and resources for critical inquiry extending and reshaping the teaching of English. This course will help future language arts teachers utilize and think critically about AI and the Internet. The inherited cultural archive is now available in digital format on-line. Complementary resources and tools
        that far exceed what is in textbooks are now available on the Internet and new genres of informational and visual texts are emerging.</p>
            
		<p align="left">The course supports teacher and student online publication, free, open-source, or low cost resources, and strategies for bringing the vast resources and communicative possibilities of the Internet and artificial intelligence to all students.

        <p align="left">Our class will be organized by this on-line syllabus. Students will likely create websites to support group teaching, work online, engage in virtual school discussions, and students will design technology enhanced teaching in the context of a laptop classroom. </p>
		  
		  <p align="left"><p align="left"><p align="center">Professional Involvement</p>
		  
        <p align="left">Future English teachers should join <a href="http://www.ncte.org" target="_blank">NCTE</a>, <a href="http://mcte.info/" target="_blank">MCTE</a>, and/or <a href="http://www.michiganreading.org/" target="_blank">MRA</a> and read 
          regularly the <i>English Journal </i>or <i>Voices from the Middle</i>.  
			
        <p align="left">An important assignment in the class is to <a href="englconference.html">attend a professional teacher conference</a>, and report on that to the rest of the class. This semester the ideal conference to attend is the <a href="https://mymcte.org/event/mcte-fall-conference-2025/" target="_blank">Michigan Council of the Teachers of English (MCTE) Conference</a> themed "Cultivating Voices in the English Classroom" and held on Friday, October 17 at the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center in East Lansing (Parking $2/hour). Register before Sept 13 and the cost for students is $60; after Sept 19 the cost is $75. (Teachers pay $155 or $175.) Must register by Oct 12. Attending the MCTE conference also gives you a 1-year membership in MCTE. </p>
		  
        <p align="left">Students are also encouraged to attend the <a href="https://convention.ncte.org/" target="_blank">National Council of the Teachers of English (NCTE) Conference</a> held this year Nov 20-23 in Denver, Colorado.      
        
		  <p align="left">Especially in this era of increasing attacks on glbt students and teaching I recommend   straight and glbt future teachers join <a href="http://www.glsen.org/" target="_blank">GLSEN</a>, the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network. </p>
               <p align="left">Teachers need to be informed about the world. Students are expected to read regularly the <em>New York Times </em>and other sources. WMU provides a <a href="http://libguides.wmich.edu/nyt" target="_blank">free <em>NYT</em> subscription</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/international" target="_blank" <em>The Guardian</em></a> is also a good news source, and can also be accessed for free.</p>
        <p align="left">
        <p align="left">Official information about the Michigan Teacher Certification test is available on the <a href="http://www.mttc.nesinc.com/" target="_blank">MTTC website</a>. </p>

          <p>Since the class is discussion-based, attendance and preparation are essential to your own learning and to the learning of your classmates. Missing any classes will affect your learning. Missing more 3 classes may lower your grade and missing 5 classes may lead to failing. Study my philosophy regarding <a href="attendancephilosophy.html" target="_blank">discussion, preparation, participation, attendance, grading, and learning</a> -- and consider your own philosophy!</p>
			
          <p>Your final course grade will be an average of grades for the major assignments, 
            listed and weighted below. At the hour scheduled for the final exam students will turn in a take home exam, discuss the course, and attend an intern teaching panel comprised of graduates of the class recently engaged in intern / early career teaching and job searching. </p>

    </blockquote>

 	  
      <p>Sep 16: <strong><em>English Journal</em>, Online Lesson Plans, &amp; Student-led Unit Planning </strong></p>
<blockquote>
   <p>1. Carefully read three or more articles from back issues of the <em>English Journal</em> that connect to your topic for the unit you will lead. Take notes you can share in class. 
	   
	   <br><br>You can subscribe to the <a href="https://ncte.org/resources/journals/english-journal/" target="_blank"><em>English 
	          Journal</em></a> (member price $25). NCTE members can read back issues of the <em><a href="https://publicationsncte.org/content/journals/ej/browse" target="_blank">English 
	            Journal</a></em> at the NCTE website on-line using their membership number 
	          as a password. To find articles connected to the unit you are going to lead will want to conduct an ERIC 
	          search (via our <a href="http://libguides.wmich.edu/content.php?pid=209545&sid=1745865" target="_blank">library database access</a>). 
	   
	   <br><br>For articles on specific topics, for example for the unit you will be leading, <strong>first</strong> set &quot;English Journal&quot; as the &quot;SO Journal Title&quot; Field. (Use quotation marks around "English Journal" - even with quotation marks on "English Journal" you may still get journals like "Arab World English Journal," which you can ignore. Look out: without the quotation marks many different journals will come up.) <strong>Second</strong>, for another Field use descriptive terms for your topic (try different key word variations relevant to the topic). (You will get the most articles if for your topic you use the field "TX All Text" which searches the full text of articles, not just titles or descriptors. Title and descriptor searches can be good if you are getting <em>too many</em> articles). </p>
<p> 2. Find three or more secondary English lesson plans available on 
          the web that you consider to be thoughtful and well-crafted and that connect to your topic for the unit you will lead. Take notes you can share in class. 
	     <br><br>There are many sources for Language Arts lesson plans on the web. Try <a href="http://readwritethink.org/" target="_blank">Read/Write/Think</a>, <a href="http://www.rayser.ca/" target="_blank">Outta 
            Ray's Head</a>, <a href="http://www.webenglishteacher.com/index.html" target="_blank">Web English Teacher</a>, <a href="http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/category/language-arts/" target="_blank">New

              Planz.com</a>, and, of course, <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> (put "lesson plan" into the search along with your topic descriptor terms)! </p>
