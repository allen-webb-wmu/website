	“’Ello Internet Fam! It’s Samson. Welcome back to my channel. Today we are at an archeological site where major discoveries are being made. Thank you to the History Channel for sponsoring this video.” 

<p class="text">SamsonDiscovers brought his camera over to the tent that was set up a couple hundred feet away from the dock. He set up the camera to capture himself having a conversation with a young archeologist. 

<p class="text">“I’m here with archeologist Dr. Sandra Holmes. She is the pioneer of this archeological endeavor. So, first of all, Dr. Holmes, where are we?” 

<p class="text">“We’re in southern Georgia right now,” the doctor answered. 

<p class="text">“Georgia is in Zone Six, right?” 

<p class="text">“Yes, it is. Zone Six is uninhabitable for more than two months at a time. We are on the border of Zones Five and Six, so it is easier for us to survive here than if we were further south. It is much too humid and hot to survive here without heat protection though,” she explained. 

<p class="text">“So, what protection is used?” 

<p class="text">“If you look at my arm, there is an IV that is constantly provided my body with fluids to prevent dehydration.” She showed the camera the IV. “The fluids are in a pouch attached to my back.” 

<p class="text">“Don’t worry Internet Fam, I got one too.” SamsonDiscovers showed the camera. “How many of these bags do you go through?” 

<p class="text">“It really depends on the season,” Dr. Holmes said. “In the winter, like now, we go through about one a day unless we have strenuous activities like moving heavy equipment. In the summer, we can go through up to seven bags per person per day.” 

<p class="text">“Woah. So, do you still have to drink water?” 

<p class="text">“Yes. We have these huge water bottles.” Dr. Holmes showed the camera a two-gallon water bottle with a bunch of conservation stickers on it. “We have to drink at least one of these a day. If we don’t, we will be removed from the project.” 

<p class="text">“What other precautions do you have take?” 

<p class="text">“We do urine tests once a week to make sure we are hydrated. We have these large fans and coolers everywhere. Since it’s hard to get proper food down here, we have meal pills that we take three times a day. This also cuts down costs so we can afford this much water and fluids.” 

<p class="text">“Wait, so you don’t eat solid food?” 

<p class="text">“I haven’t had real food in two months,” Dr. Holmes told the camera. 

<p class="text">“Wow, so what are you doing in such a dangerous location?” 

<p class="text">“We are trying to find Disney World. It was flooded when the sea level rose, consuming Florida.” 

<p class="text">“How do you find a place like that?” 

<p class="text">“Any project like this starts with digital archaeology.” Dr. Holmes pulled out a bulky computer with a handle from seventy years ago. “We stare with just a general search of the internet for floods within the last twenty years.” Dr. Holmes typed flood impact areas last 20 years. “Then we narrow down the area we want to focus on.” North America Zone 6. “From there we will pick a flood or time frame.” 2050-2070. “Then we will cross reference that with the most searched locations from five years before. We found that Disney World was the most searched location in Zone Six in North America from 2050 to 2065. From there we narrowed down that it was consumed by Flood Gama in 2063. We used maps from the time, like Google Maps or Apple Maps, and cross referenced them with our maps of the modern ocean. That’s where we got the coordinates that we are going to be diving today.” 

<p class="text">“Can I come too?” 

<p class="text">“Oh, you have to. Let’s go!” 

<p class="text">SamsonDiscovers followed Dr. Holmes to the boat. The boat was enclosed on all sides to prevent the sun from causing heat-related injury. Or death. While they took the boat ride, Dr. Holmes, another archaeologist, and SamsonDiscovers put on thick waterproof suits. 

<p class="text">“So, Dr. H told me that these suits have sensors that track your heart rate, hydration level, temperature, and even how much energy you’re using.” SamsonDiscovers told the camera. “They’ll be monitoring us from up here to make sure we don’t die while we’re in the water.” 

<p class="text">The boat stopped. 

<p class="text">“Okay, put on your mask,” Dr. Holmes ordered. 

<p class="text">All three divers put on their masks. A door opened at the side of the boat. They dove into the polluted water. SamsonDiscovers recorded the path they took. At first, they could see nothing through the waste that was floating around them. 

<p class="text">Then the faded blue roof of a tower came into view.
