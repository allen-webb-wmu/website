        <p align="center"><font size="5" color="#3399FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Theory and Practice of Teaching English</strong></font> </p>
        
        <p align="center">
        <p align="left">This graduate seminar provides a  review of the theory and practice of teaching English  to a cohort of future secondary English teachers in the WMU MAT teacher certification program. The seminar will  interact with the intern teaching placement and draw on the rich and diverse backgrounds the MAT graduate students bring to the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">The seminar will be informed by a justice, inquiry, and action approach to teaching secondary English. In so doing we will address the range of responsbilities of a secondary language arts teacher, including theory and best practive of teaching, literature, writing, language, and speaking.  We will learn about reform movements in the the teaching of English including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader-response_criticism" target="_blank">reader response</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_theory_of_composition" target="_blank">process theory of composition</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy" target="_blank">digital literacy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_pedagogy" target="_blank">critical pedagogy</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies" target="_blank">cultural studies</a>. </p>
        <p align="left">(In this course the term "critical inquiry" is in the tradition of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory" target="_blank">critical theory</a>," not the more abstracted, decontextualized, and superficial approach of "<a href="https://www.rasmussen.edu/student-experience/college-life/critical-thinking-skills-to-master-now/" target="_blank">critical thinking skills</a>." Likewise, the term "<a href="https://www.sac.edu/AcademicAffairs/TracDat/Pages/Inquiry-Based-Learning-.aspx" target="_blank">inquiry</a>" is richer than the simpler, but also of value, expression "<a href="http://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/energy-and-the-polar-environment/questioning-techniques-research-based-strategies-for-teachers" target="_blank">questioning strategies</a>.")</p>

        <p align="left">In an era of anti-democratic governmentality, attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion, efforts to ban books and limit curriculum, neoliberalism, standardized testing, the corporatization of curriculum, future teachers need to think critically, independently, and consider how to develop the freedom they need to prepare their students as global citizens in an unfinished democracy threatened by demogoguery, inequality, and global warming. </p>
       
        <p align="center">Justice, Inquiry, and Action</p>
        <p align="left">The starting point  for a justice, inquiry, and action approach to teaching secondary English is engaging with critical issues in the world and in the lives of adolescents via relevant and meaningful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_learning" target="_blank">thematic curriculum</a>. In dialogue with student questions and interest, English language arts teachers should be able to  bring together a wide  range of cultural materials, including traditional works, multicultural and young adult literature, visual and media texts including film, and cultural and informational texts, and address <em>what</em> texts mean, as well as <em>how</em> they mean, in historical, cultural, political, and social contexts. A major assignment will be to create a unit plan with a justice, inquiry, and action approach.</p>
        <p align="left">In English 6920 teachers are considered to be <em>transformative intellectuals</em>, producers rather than transmitters of knowledge. More than simply being a <em>reflective</em> pracitioner who can rethink teaching practices in order to improve them, this course also aims to prepare you to be a <em>critical</em> practitioner, a teacher who leads inquiry into social, cultural, and ideological issues, and finds ways to support students acting upon what they learn. We will explore these skills in the real world context of the internships you are involved in.</p>

        <p align="left">Several areas of interest have already been identified in prior conversation, especially teaching in the era of artificial intelligence and tools like ChatGPT, and working with ELL students for whom English is a second language.  Class time will be devoted to these topics and there will be assignments to develop creative and effective teaching in both areas.  </p>
        

        <p align="left"><p align="center">Professional Involvement
        <p align="left">Future English teachers should join <a href="http://www.ncte.org" target="_blank">NCTE</a>, <a href="http://mymcte.org/" target="_blank">MCTE</a>, and/or <a href="http://www.michiganreading.org/" target="_blank">MRA</a> and read regularly the <i>English Journal </i>or <i>Voices from the Middle</i>.  
			
        <p align="left">An important assignment in the class is to <a href="englconference.html">attend a professional teacher conference</a>, and report on that to the rest of the class. This semester the ideal conference to attend is the <a href="https://mymcte.org/event/mcte-fall-conference-2025/" target="_blank">Michigan Council of the Teachers of English (MCTE) Conference</a> themed "Cultivating Voices in the English Classroom" and held on Friday, October 17 at the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center in East Lansing (Parking $2/hour). Register before Sept 13 and the cost for students is $60; after Sept 19 the cost is $75. (Teachers pay $155 or $175.) Must register by Oct 12. Attending the MCTE conference also gives you a 1-year membership in MCTE. </p>
		  
        <p align="left">Students are also encouraged to attend the <a href="https://convention.ncte.org/" target="_blank">National Council of the Teachers of English (NCTE) Conference</a> held this year Nov 20-23 in Denver, Colorado. If finances present a challenge, seek support and be creative, for example, the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/w54mmvs" target="_blank">gofundme</a> approach.</p>
        
        <p align="left">Especially in this era of increasing attacks on glbt students and teaching I recommend gay and straight future teachers join <a href="http://www.glsen.org/" target="_blank">GLSEN</a>, the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network. </p>
		  
        <p align="left">Teachers need to be informed about the world. Students are expected to read regularly the <em>New York Times </em>and other sources. WMU provides a <a href="http://libguides.wmich.edu/nyt" target="_blank">free <em>NYT</em> subscription</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/international" target="_blank" <em>The Guardian</em> </a> is also a good news source, and can also be accessed for free.</p>
	
       
        <p align="left">Official information about the Michigan Teacher Certification test is available 
          on the <a href="http://www.mttc.nesinc.com/" target="_blank">MTTC website</a>. </p>
	
        <p align="center">Course Success        
        <div align="left">
			
          <p>Since the seminar is discussion-based, attendance and preparation are essential to your own learning and to the learning of your classmates. Missing any seminars will impact your learning. Missing more two seminar meetings may lower your grade and missing more than three may lead to failing. Study my philosophy regarding <a href="attendancephilosophy.html" target="_blank">discussion, preparation, participation, attendance, grading, and learning</a> -- and consider your own philosophy!</p>
			
          <p>Your final course grade will be an average of grades for the major assignments, listed and weighted below.  </p>
          <p>This course will follow WMU policies regarding <a href="honestypolicy.html" target="_blank">academic honesty</a>.      </p>

        <p>At WMU, one out of every ten students were born in another country. More than 94 countries are represented on the WMU campus. Wherever you or your family are from, WMU affirms that you are welcome here. I am committed to doing everything I can to ensure that every student, regardless of immigration status, is safe in this classroom. I will not create or maintain records that could be used by federal agencies to implicate members of our community as undocumented. I will not allow ICE or other groups into the classroom without an official signed judicial warrant and consult with campus safety.
