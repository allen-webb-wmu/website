<p class="text">As I opened my eyes, I could hear the sounds of rainfall pounding against my window, as if a powerful storm was on the horizon. I dragged myself out of bed, the warmth of my blankets fading away as I stepped into the cold air. My family and I had decided to visit Japan, since my uncle and aunt were hosting a family reunion. Most of my family is within Japan, except for my father, who had flown to America to study aerospace engineering, specifically astronautics. Due to the substantial impact of climate change on Earth, he and many other scientists, engineers, and businessmen had been in search of habitable planets to escape to should the temperature of Earth go any higher than it already is. The government of Japan declared a state of emergency around the time we got stuck here, as the Earth’s temperature had become 4 degrees hotter than it was supposed to. Because of this, several disasters related to weather had become more frequent and destructive.

  <p class="text">As I walked down the hallway to the kitchen, I could hear the air conditioning blasting in almost every room, as the temperatures outside had become unbearable, despite it being early autumn. My brother, Masaki, was in the living room, sitting at the kotatsu, his eyes full of fear. 

  <p class="text">“Mirai! There’s another typhoon again!!” he exclaimed. “There’s another hurricane on the way here!”

  <p class="text">I turned towards the TV, and on NHK, they had declared that another typhoon would make landfall, possibly sometime during the day, meaning that all flights in and out of the country would be suspended. I turned back over to Masaki, his eyes welling up with tears as he slammed his fist on top of the kotatsu.

<p class="text">“I really thought we would make it home this time!” he shouted, his eyes wet with tears. 

  <p class="text">I could understand Masaki’s pain. We have been stuck here for close to two years at this point, since there have been many catastrophic weather events in both Japan and the United States that we haven’t been able to get tickets to fly back home. My parents have had to rely on neighbors to get rid of all our expired food, and my father has been struggling to make sure we still have a home in America. Housing in Japan has become very expensive, since residents from coastal cities like Yokohama and Hiroshima, have been almost completely destroyed due to the winds and flooding from typhoons. 

  <p class="text">Just then, my mother tapped my shoulder. “M-Mirai…Could you please go down to the complex?” my mother asked, her voice shaking. “Our weekly food crate has been delivered.”
  The complex used to be an old warehouse near the outskirts of Tokyo, but with the destruction of a major port in Yokohama from one of the more recent typhoons, most of the warehouses had to take their stock inland. While most of the more rural parts of the country have only been slightly affected, the news reporters often talk about how several places of agriculture have been moved to places in the far north, since it is simply too hot. Since the heat is unbearable, the government developed several inventions in order for people to survive the heat.

  <p class="text">I went back into my bedroom to grab all my equipment before going outside. I opened my closet door and pulled out my bodysuit, which was created by the brand Snow Peak. It was created to protect the skin from the cold air of the CryoVest X2, which I layered over my bodysuit. The CryoVest X2 had been created when the Earth had become 3 degrees warmer than it was supposed to be. I took my vest off the wall and draped it around my shoulders, wrapping the belt around my waist. It had two pouches, one with an IV that would provide hydration, and the other pouch held the electronics required to keep the vest functional, thankfully all the wires are inside the vest, so there’s no risk of them snagging on things. There’s also an attachable hood for sun protection, which also doubles as a shield from the rain. I also pulled on some knee-length jorts, since they are good for travelling through the streets and allow for movement. I’ve had them for around two years, so they’ve deteriorated and have needed repair, but with how scarce resources are, going shopping for clothes is low on the priority list.

  <p class="text">After leaving my bedroom, I made my way through the hallway. Photos of my mom and aunt hung on the walls, reflecting a time that has long since passed. When I was in school back in America, we were reading a book that had been written nearly 50 years ago, which stated predictions about the climate of Earth. Back then, I wasn’t concerned, as I thought something would be done. Oh, how 15-year-old me would be horrified.

  <p class="text">As I arrived back into the kitchen, Masaki and Mom were sitting at the table, the laptop in front of them. My mother looked up at me, her eyes filled with fear, and worry. I glanced at the screen, as they had been watching the local weather to make sure that things wouldn’t get bad before we could properly prepare. “The hurricane is going to hit tonight, so please be careful while going to The Complex.” Mom warned. “The train line won’t run after 4:00PM, so make sure you get the crate and immediately head to the train.”

  <p class="text">I nodded. Considering the fact that the warehouse is just outside Yokohama, being in the area when the hurricane strikes would cost not only my life, but the lives of others going there for supplies as well. “I’ll be careful, Mom.” I said. “I’ll get back as fast as possible.”

<p class="text">My mother got up, embracing me, followed by Masaki. “Be safe out there Mirai,” he shakily whispered. “We can’t lose you like how we lost Oba.”

  <p class="text">My Oba, Himari, was involved with a volunteer organization that was tasked with rescuing people from the flooded areas of Yokohama and other coastal cities. But after the most recent typhoon, she went missing. I still remember my mother’s face when two police officers came to the apartment to inform her of the situation. That night, she practically cried herself to sleep. Masaki was also deeply affected by her disappearance as well, since he and Himari were close due to their shared interests of marine biology. 

  <p class="text">As I left the apartment, I felt the cold touch of the rain as it fell. Walking down the stairs, I could feel a sense of melancholy. Things felt empty, and the state of the world made things even worse. The sound of rain falling onto the ground used to be quite calming to me when I was a child, but now, it reminds me of the disaster and tragedy of these major weather events. 

<p class="text">All of a sudden, I heard a familiar voice calling out to me as I approached the gate that led outside the apartment. 

  <p class="text">I turned towards the voice and saw it was Kagami, one of my friends that I had been close with since I was a child. 

<p class="text">“Mirai! It’s been such a long time!” Kagami exclaimed.

<p class="text">“It really has,” I said. “It’s so nice to see you!”

  <p class="text">Kagami pulled out her phone, which was decorated with a sparkly purple case, which matched nicely with the raincoat she was wearing over her vest. Even despite the things she had faced before I arrived, she still remained optimistic. She lives with her mother and little sister, and had been studying fashion at a university in Tokyo for a couple years at this point, and had also been an active member of a group that wanted the government to take climate change seriously, much like her father was when he was her age. We’ve occasionally spoken on the phone, and she had told me that her dad was meeting with leaders from other nations all over the world about the climate crisis, since he’s a politician.  

 <p class="text">We continued to walk down the streets to get to the train station, which would take us to Yokohama to pick up our crates. The government originally tried to send it to people’s houses; but there had been reports of stolen crates, so the idea was quickly scrapped. Thankfully, by the time we arrived at the station, the train was just pulling in, so we didn’t have to stand outside in the rain for too long. As we stepped on the train, Kagami turned to me. 

<p class="text">“I can’t believe that another typhoon might come.” Kagami said. “This climate change stuff is so stupid!”

  <p class="text">I nodded in agreement. “Yeah, we still haven't been able to get a flight home due to all the weather.” I explained. “With the temperature sitting at four degrees warmer than it’s supposed too, these weather events seem to be getting even more intense.”

  <p class="text">I stared out the window at the flooded landscape below, houses, schools, and businesses had all been destroyed by flooding. Most buildings were covered in overgrowth from plants, while others had roofs that had caved in from the structures slowly falling apart. Even a few larger buildings and shrines scattered around the city were slowly collapsing.  These places, once full of joy, wonder, and bliss, are now wastelands with no real way to rebuild. What’s worse is the fact that the sea levels will continue to rise as the Earth becomes hotter. Masaki once told me that coral reefs were essential to the biodiversity in the ocean, and with the ocean becoming more and more acidic, these reefs would also be destroyed too.

  <p class="text">As we arrived at Yokohama station, it seemed like the rain had gotten much worse, as there were a lot of people carrying umbrellas or wearing rain ponchos and coats. Kagami and I began making our way to the warehouse, using the giant inside near the entrance to indicate our crates were picked up. I took my ID out of the small pouch attached to my belt and tapped it on the screen. After a couple seconds, a blue circle appeared, indicating my sign in was successful and the attendant went to grab my crate. The crates had this silver reflective material on them, so heat wouldn’t be able to spoil any of the perishable things inside. Even just leaving something like ice cream outside for 5 minutes would melt it immediately. 

  <p class="text">The attendant came back and handed me my crate, which had everything we would need for the next few weeks until the next shipment. Kagami was waiting by the entrance with hers so we could walk back together. When we got outside, the rain and the wind somehow got even more intense, as people were sprinting to get to the station or the warehouse. As we walked through the alley to get to the road leading back to the station, I noticed the water up ahead was receding into the ocean. 

<p class="text">“Hey Kagami,” I asked. “Do you see the water receding?" 

  <p class="text">Kagami raised an eyebrow before turning to look at the water. “Yeah, that seems really strange.” she said looking back at me. “Its almost as if you can hear waves in the distance.”

S<p class="text">uddenly, a loud siren started blaring, echoing throughout the entire town as a voice came on.

<p class="text"><p class="text">“Attention all residents of Kanagawa prefecture, the Japan Meteorological Agency has declared a Tsunami warning for the city of Yokohama has been issued. Please evacuate and seek shelter immediately.” 

<p class="text">“Run!” Kagami screamed, grabbing my hand.

  <p class="text">We both ran for our lives, as it was a race against the clock to get back to the train before the waves made landfall.  The rain obscured my vision as I tried to keep a grip on Kagami’s hand. Suddenly, I slipped on the slick blacktop, and fell on my face, blood gushing out of my nose. Although I was able to pick myself back up, I glanced out into the water and saw the wave coming at full speed.

<p class="text">“Mirai! Are you okay?!” Kagami asked, her voice cracking as she tried to catch her breath.

<p class="text">“I’m fine, but we need to get back to the station before the train leaves!” I exclaimed, grasping Kagami’s hand once more.

  <p class="text">We continued to run towards the station, and thankfully we had made it. But we suddenly got shoved aside by a large group of people desperately trying to get to the train as well. Kagami got shoved between them while they shoved me out. As I tried to get into the train, I remembered my mother and Masaki, they both were counting on me to bring food and supplies back, and I had failed. But then, I had an idea. I locked eyes with Kagami and threw my crate to her. I watched as the crate flew through the air, past all the people who had shoved me away from the train, and into her arms.

 <p class="text">“Kagami!” I yelled. “Get these to my family, they need it to survive!”

  <p class="text">Before Kagami could say anything, the train doors closed, and it sped away into the city. 

  <p class="text">The water’s impact hit like a truck. My entire body felt like it was being broken apart, as if it were made of glass. As I slowly sank, I was completely numb, the dark waters were swallowing me whole as I watched the light of the surface get further and further away from me. Even if I could swim back up, I had no idea what would await me, and with the demise of Yokohama, the only thing I felt was a sense of hopelessness and liminality. Maybe it’s because…I knew that it was over.

<p class="text">***

<p class="text">As I opened my eyes, I was greeted by a blue sky and large fluffy white clouds. I sat up, unable to process what had just happened. As I examined my surroundings, I realized I was on a beach, with lots of trees that still had their lush green leaves. A gentle breeze blew through my tangled hair. I didn’t understand this, I basically drowned from the tsunami’s violent waters, did I somehow survive?

Raging Waters was written with the goal of being completely AI free. The main reason why I chose not to use AI for any fragment of this project is because it is harmful to those who have spent years of their lives dedicating themselves to their craft, whether that is art, writing, music, or any other creative medium. My best friend right now is putting herself through art school to one day be an animator, as she had been inspired by shows when she was a kid, which were made with human talent and genuine love for the medium. But people who use AI have very little understanding of the importance of human made work, and why it has taken such a long time for people to finally perfect their craft. Not to mention that major companies are training AI by straight up stealing  real artists’ work, making it even harder to tell if a piece is AI or not. This cements the fact that any piece of written work or images generated with AI, are made using stolen art from real, human, artists. Plus there is also the fact that AI has a major environmental impact, especially with the construction of data centers affecting the people who live by them not having access to water, or dealing with polluted air. The point is, AI cannot reflect true human creativity, as it essentially steals different mediums of creativity, and spits out hollow, emotionless, and unimaginative slop, replacing real creativity with complete emptiness.
