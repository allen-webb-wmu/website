      <ul>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Write 
          a letter </font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">to 
          your students letting them know about you, your interests, and why you 
          want to be a teacher. Invite them to write back to you.<br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Write 
          a letter to the parents of your students introducing yourself and talking 
          about your commitment to teaching English to their kids. Invite them 
          to drop in on the class, call you at home, etc. </font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000"><br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000"> <font color="#000000" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Let 
          yourself learn from your mentor, even if their approach is different 
          from yours. Use the traditional approaches and also develop more innovative 
          ones.</font></font></li>
        <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Work 
          hard at developing your relationship with your mentor(s). Active listening 
          and careful questioning is essential in the early stages. Try to develop 
          a personal as well as a professional connection. Tell them (and show 
          them) that they can trust you. Never put your mentor down in front of 
          students. If there is a serious problem with your mentor, seek a change 
          in the very first weeks. If a problem develops or continues involve 
          outside people soon!<br>
        </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Try 
          to turn negative comments about students by your mentor or other teachers 
          into positives by asking about ways that you as a new teacher might 
          work effectively with this (or similar) students.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000"> <font color="#000000" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Introduce 
          yourself </font><font color="#000000" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">to 
          principals and vice principals. Be sure that before student teaching 
          is over they have visited your class and watched you teach. (They are 
        good sources for feedback and recommendations.) </font></font></li>
        <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">It is great to get input from your university supervisor -- I think it best if your university supervisor observes you teach at least twice.</font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000"><br>
        </font> </li>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font color="#000000" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Record</font><font color="#000000" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> yourself teaching 
          several times and analyze carefully.<br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Read 
          Harry Wong's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0962936022/teachersnet/"><i>First 
          Day of School</i> </a>-- while I don't think he is a great theorist about good teaching, he does have many specific suggestions for how to set a professional tone from the first day  helpful to new teachers.<br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Go 
          back over materials from your methods and education courses. Be alert to the ways that you become &quot;channeled&quot; 
          into the pedagogical practice of your mentor and don't give up experimenting 
          with approaches.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000"> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Give 
          your students a list of outside reading and viewing that you recommend. 
          (Play it safe.)</font> <br>
        </font> </li>
        <li> <font color="#000000" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Move 
          student desks frequently and creatively. It will free up your pedagogy, 
          assert your control over the space of the classroom, link content and 
          process, and help with discipline. <br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">If 
          you have discipline problems with particular students seek them out 
          outside of classtime for one-on-one conversation. Ask them how <i>you</i> 
          can help make the class a place that <i>they</i> will enjoy.</font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000"><br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Once 
          you are several weeks into student teaching, graciously but firmly insist 
          that you need to be developing some of the curriculum, including multicultural 
          approaches, planning lessons independently, etc. Point out that the 
          university evaluation your intern teaching requires that you have been 
          able to show that you can do these things. </font><font color="#000000" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Take 
          photographs of your students and copy samples of their best work for 
          you to keep. Be sure to have their permission, and perhaps their parents, to do this -- your school or district likely has policies for you to follow in this area, learn about and follow them. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Allow for the posibility of staying in touch with your students
          after you leave the classroom. Have them write an evaluation of you 
          at least twice during intern teaching. You can learn a great deal from 
        your students about how to improve. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000"> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">At WMU you are supposed to fill out your midterm and final self-evaluation 
          of intern teaching <i>before </i>your mentor evaluates you. (You do 
          not have to allow negative evaluations from your mentor to be put in 
          your placement file.) </font><br>
        </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000"> Let people know you will be looking 
          for a position.<br>
        </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">WMU used to have a policy against interns 
          doing &quot;extra duties&quot; especially during your 
          preparation hour. I am told this policy has changed.<br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font color="#000000" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Attend 
          all professional events </font><font color="#000000" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">such 
          as faculty meetings, committee meetings, teacher parties, etc. Attend 
          professional conferences while you are intern teaching. <br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Be 
          enthusiastic about interning and teaching -- you are making a professional 
          impression from the first day.<br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Speak 
          up for WMU teacher education program. Talking up 
          your program's strengths will make you look good and your degree more valuable. 
          Let mentors know about what is being learned and discussed at the university 
          these days. If mentors challenge your preparation, point to the things 
          you have learned, invite them to read some of the professional books 
          you have read (and join you at a professional conference!), explain 
          your philosophy of teaching as well as you can, and express your willingness 
          to keep learning.<br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#000000">Keep 
          your own personal balance. Exercise. Make time for yourself. Find good 
        listeners and process your experiences with them.</font></li>
