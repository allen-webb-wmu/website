        <p>
        <p align="left">Flash memoir is a concise, powerful form of creative nonfiction that captures a single, significant moment or memory, using brevity to reveal larger dimensions of your life, much like a snapshot or a "flash" of insight. It focuses on intense, specific details and emotional resonance rather than exhaustive storytelling, making every word count to create a  impact and connect readers to a fuller understanding of yourself, values, and activities.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">For the sake of this assignment your memoir is not really "nonfiction" but instead  a personal, speculative fiction set in the future (or maybe set in the  future considering a moment in the past). Closely related to "microfiction" and "flash fiction," a flash memoir can be quite short, even a few words or sentences. For this assignment consider the length of a flash memoir to be between 500 and 1000 words.</p>
        <p align="left">(In psychology this kind of work is called "<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29130061/" target="_blank">episodic future thinking</a>" which some psychology researchers have even tied with increasing motivation to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00218/full"target="_blank">address climate change.)</a></p>
<p align="left">The idea for this flash memoir is for you to explore your future --&nbsp; your career, life, friends, family, living situation, activities -- to consider ways you might be addressing the climate emergency say 20 years from now - 2046? Or looking backward from 2046 at a revealing moment of climate related action in your life in some prior year.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">The flash memoir is only capturing a carefully imagined and detailed moment, but that moment can and should reveal such things as: how the career you chose, how you acted or are acting as a citizen, how you collaborated with friends or family, or how you resisted dominant practices or groups -in short how you are/ were/could be involved in addressing the climate emergency.</p>
        <p align="left">I ask you to compose this memoir in the light of all we have read this semester and especially in the context of the inspiring example of Vanessa Nakate. I hope that the real you, your personality, values, interest, life plans and aspirations is clearly present in your flash memoir. I am saying you can be inspired by Vanessa Nakate or other ways people take action on climate but also be true to yourself.</p>
        <p align="left">You can certainly learn more about Flash Memoirs from various sources online.&nbsp; Here are a couple that look pretty good to me: <a href="https://www.writermag.com/improve-your-writing/nonfiction/micro-memoir/" target="_blank">A Guide to the Micro-Memoir</a>, <a href="https://writeradvice.com/2020-flash-memoir-winners/" target="_blank">Flash Memoir Award Winners</a> (includes 4 examples), <a href="https://ucwbling.chicagolandwritingcenters.org/flash-fiction-memoir-with-nic-j/" target="_blank">Chicago Land Writing Center</a> (includes links to examples.</p>
