<p class="text">When Leilani was a child, the reef glowed like a city at night—neon parrotfish, blue starfish, coral that pulsed pink and gold. Now, at twenty-nine, she floats above it in silence.
<p class="text">White. Bone white. As if the sea had been boiled and drained of color.
<p class="text">Her oxygen bubbles rise too fast. The water is warmer than it should be. It always is now.
<p class="text">She surfaces near the canoe where her uncle waits, his skin weathered into a map of years spent fishing waters that no longer fish back.
<p class="text"><p class="text">“Anything?” he asks.
<p class="text">She shakes her head. “No recovery. The heatwave finished it.”
<p class="text">He nods, unsurprised. Grief here has become repetitive, almost procedural.
<p class="text">Back on shore, the village council meets beneath solar panels bolted onto a concrete schoolhouse roof—installed after the last cyclone tore through the island, stronger than any on record. The elders speak of leaving. Of New Zealand. Of Australia. Of becoming paperwork.
<p class="text">Leilani listens, thinking of the reef as it was, as she studied it in textbooks, as she documented its death for international databases that filled reports but never reversed trends.
<p class="text">That night, children gather around her laptop to watch old footage she archived years ago. The reef alive. Fish everywhere.
<p class="text">“Did it really look like that?” a boy asks.
<p class="text"><p class="text">“Yes,” she says. “And warmer oceans killed it.”
<p class="text">“Can it come back?”
<p class="text">She hesitates. Science says no. Not without cooling the planet. Not <p class="text">without stopping emissions that continue, globally, despite promises.
<p class="text">“Only in stories,” she finally answers.
<p class="text">Later, she uploads her latest survey to a server thousands of miles away, powered by data centers she knows consume more energy than her entire island ever did.
<p class="text">Before sleeping, she records a final reminder in her field journal: 1.5 degrees was never safe. It was just the first lie we told ourselves.

	<p class="text">
In developing the stories, ChatGPT was most useful as a collaborative drafting tool rather than a replacement for my own writing. I gave it prompts that specified temperature thresholds, locations, and themes from the book, and then evaluated what it produced. Often, the first drafts leaned toward generality or over explanation. I learned quickly that meaningful cli-fi requires editing against that tendency, cutting down exposition and strengthening character perspective. The most successful moments came when I rewrote passages to emphasize emotion, silence, and moral tension rather than scientific description.
